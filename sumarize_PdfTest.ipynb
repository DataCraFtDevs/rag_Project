The study also highlights\\ntwo important social and policy implications of digitally-enabled circular business models: Firstly,\\nthe creation of new employment opportunities through the empowerment of a new labour force\\nfor the circular plastic economy; secondly, the heightened opportunity to enact an innovative\\nsharing economy in typically resource-constrained contexts in which otherwise idle products and\\nresources are more efficiently used in a process of collaborative consumption.\\n1. Introduction\\nGlobal conversation about the merits and imperative of a circular economy has gained significant traction over the past decade.\\nAlong with this, scholars and stakeholders are focusing attention on market arguments for the circular economy, recognising this as a\\nkey factor in challenging, and changing, the entrenched production systems and consumption habits associated with the linear\\neconomy paradigm of make-take-dispose. In other words, the global circular economy campaigns need to be backed up by circular\\nbusiness models that effectively create, deliver and capture value through the creation and distribution of circular products and\\nservices. On the African continent, discussions about circular business models are in relatively earlier stages of development. Yet the\\n* Corresponding author.\\nE-mail address: s.kolade@shu.ac.uk (O.

The reasons for this are two-fold. Firstly, because African countries are still in relatively earlier stages of industrialisation,\\nthey are not locked in to old, “dirtier” technologies, and are therefore relatively less susceptible to lock-in mechanisms of sunk in-\\nvestment, economies of scale, economies of scope, network externalities and technology inter-relatedness, among others (Kolade et al.,\\n2022). Secondly, widespread unemployment and poverty across the continent paradoxically offer new opportunities to create an\\ninclusive economy that empowers new economic actors through the implementation of innovative, circular business models (Morais\\net al., 2022).\\nThe present study focuses on the pressing challenge of plastic pollution and the market opportunities offered by the circular plastic\\neconomy in Africa. Plastic pollution is a major environmental challenge of the 21st century (Hildago-Crespo et al., 2022), and African\\ncountries are especially vulnerable because of limited institutional capacities and policy attention to mitigate the deleterious impacts\\nof plastic waste (Oyinlola et al., 2022). Across the coasts of Africa, millions of tonnes of plastics are being dumped annually, a sig-\\nnificant portion of which originates from outside the continent’s shores. In examining the complex and escalating plastic waste crisis in\\nAfrica, it is imperative to consider the entire value chain, including production, usage, and disposal stages (Kolade, 2023; Schro¨der and\\nOyinlola, 2023; Hildago-Crespo et al., 2020). The continent grapples with a critical challenge: less than 5% of its plastic waste is\\nrecycled, leaving the vast majority to be managed through unregulated means such as landfills, open burning, and water body disposal\\n(UNEP, 2018; Babayemi et al., 2019). This issue is examined through comparative analyses of plastic waste management practices in\\nRwanda, Kenya, and South Africa, shedding light on the variances and commonalities across national strategies (Uche, 2023).\\nWhile Sub-Saharan Africa currently contribute the least to global plastic waste, its burgeoning population, evolving consumption\\npatterns, and rapid urbanisation are projected to significantly increase plastic waste generation (Moyen Massa and Archodoulaki,\\n2024). Current insights into Africa’s plastic value chain are sparse, yet it is known that the continent’s plastic production is consid-\\nerably lower than in other regions, accounting for merely 7% of global output in conjunction with the Middle East (Babayemi et al.,\\n2019; Mofo, 2020). To satisfy local demand, a substantial number of polymers and plastics are imported, with an estimated 172 million\\ntonnes brought in from 1990 to 2017 across the 54 African countries (Babayemi et al., 2019).\\nInitiatives like Rwanda’s prohibition of single-use plastics, with similar bans implemented by 36 African countries (Atta-\\nfuah-Wadee and Tilkanen, 2020), highlight the pressing necessity for all-encompassing strategies that not only aim to minimize waste\\nbut also promote recycling and sustainable consumption habits. The 2018 ban on plastic waste imports by China has significantly\\nimpacted the global flow of such materials, resulting in a marked increase in the amount of plastic waste being imported into African\\ncountries. Regarding consumption, data indicates that per capita plastic usage was around 16 kg in 2015. Moreover, the United Nations\\nhas reported that approximately 99% of plastics are used for less than six months (Ayeleru et al., 2020; Babayemi et al., 2019). Amidst\\nthese challenges, the last decade has seen the emergence of numerous small-scale enterprises that collaborate closely with the informal', metadata={'source': '/Users/admin/Documents/pdf_file_blobs/-files-94614918-Ajala2024VoR.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/admin/Documents/pdf_file_blobs/-files-94614918-Ajala2024VoR.pdf', 'page': 2, 'total_pages': 17, 'Author': 'Kolade et al', 'CreationDate': \"D:20240529140251+01'00'\", 'Creator': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro DC (64-bit) 21.1.20135', 'ModDate': \"D:20240529140401+01'00'\", 'Producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro DC (64-bit) 21.1.20135', 'Title': 'Digitally enabled business models for a circular plastic economy in Africa'}), Document(page_content='these challenges, the last decade has seen the emergence of numerous small-scale enterprises that collaborate closely with the informal\\nsector. These entities are pioneering the reclamation of plastic waste as a valuable economic resource, marking a significant step\\ntowards addressing the continent’s plastic waste problem (Oyinlola et al., 2022). However, much of these efforts continue to be driven\\nby sheer necessity and survival imperatives, and little is known about emerging circular business and innovation ecosystems and\\nassociated market opportunities that can accelerate the transition to a circular plastic economy in Africa.\\nFurthermore, much of the extant scholarship and current campaigns for circular plastic economy, globally and within the African\\ncontinent, have focused mainly on the environmental and sustainability imperative. These will continue to have compelling and\\ncritical relevance in the global conversation. Within Africa, the pertinence of the environmental and sustainability imperative is\\naccentuated by the wide-ranging and far-reaching social and economic impacts of plastic pollution. The increasing volume of plastic\\nwaste in Africa has upended community livelihoods and induced poverty through the deleterious effects of plastic wastes on the\\nnatural ecosystem and the entire marine habitat. Still, the challenge of plastic wastes has persisted due to the overriding economic logic\\nand lock-in mechanisms that drive the linear plastic economy, making it a source of profit and wealth for many in the linear ecosystem.\\nDigital technologies can play a key role in the drive to upend the lock-in to linear economy and promote new habits of production\\nand consumption (Kolade et al., 2022). With regard to circular design and manufacturing, digital technologies are essential in\\nadvancing the development of recyclable and sustainable products. These innovations support the creation of goods designed with\\ntheir lifecycle in mind, ensuring that they can be reused, repurposed, or recycled effectively, in line with the objectives of a more\\nsustainable and environment-friendly circular economy. Some frontier technologies, like 3D printing, are also well suited for\\nre-manufacturing using recyclable products. In terms of consumption, digital innovations enable the mobilisation of an inter-sectoral\\nnetwork of consumers and stakeholders to popularise circular products and generate new economic opportunities for other actors in\\nthe circular value chain. For example, digital platforms that facilitate product tracking and materials passports can empower con-\\nsumers and stakeholders to participate actively in the lifecycle of products. Similarly, innovations like blockchain technology can\\ncreate transparent supply chains, ensuring that materials can be traced back to their origins (Kolade, 2023). This enhances\\naccountability and provides new economic opportunities for other actors in the circular economy ecosystem.\\nGiven this background, this paper makes two important contributions to the extant literature: firstly, it underlines and explicates\\nthe importance of a market driven approach to circular plastic economy on the African continent, an underexplored area that has not\\nattracted significant attention among scholars. It also highlights the possibilities and opportunities for digital transformation of the\\nAfrican informal circular plastic economy and the concomitant empowerment of otherwise invisible informal actors such as waste\\npickers. In terms of policy implications and practical applications, the paper explores a market case for circular plastics as a potential\\ngame changer, in terms of its capacity to focus the minds of stakeholders, create demands and empower otherwise economically\\ninvisible actors to harness the new opportunities offered by a circular plastic economy.\\nThus, in order to drive the transition from a linear to a circular plastic economy, there is a need for an economic logic that', metadata={'source': '/Users/admin/Documents/pdf_file_blobs/-files-94614918-Ajala2024VoR.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/admin/Documents/pdf_file_blobs/-files-94614918-Ajala2024VoR.pdf', 'page': 2, 'total_pages': 17, 'Author': 'Kolade et al', 'CreationDate': \"D:20240529140251+01'00'\", 'Creator': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro DC (64-bit) 21.1.20135', 'ModDate': \"D:20240529140401+01'00'\", 'Producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro DC (64-bit) 21.1.20135', 'Title': 'Digitally enabled business models for a circular plastic economy in Africa'}), Document(page_content='Thus, in order to drive the transition from a linear to a circular plastic economy, there is a need for an economic logic that\\ncomplements and reinforces the ecological imperative.

Such socio-technical\\ntransition requires a combination of innovative circular business models and digital innovations to promote it. This paper therefore\\nraises two related research questions: firstly, in what ways can digital technologies enable new business model innovations in the\\ncircular plastic economy in Africa? Secondly, what are the impacts of digitally enabled circular business models across the supply and\\nvalue chains for employment generation and market growth? The first research question is conceptual; the second empirical. The\\nresearch questions will help to unpack the processes through which digital innovations enable stakeholders to create, deliver and\\ncapture new forms of value in the circular plastic economy; and the impacts of these innovations for retailing and distribution of\\ncircular plastic products.\\nThe rest of the paper is organised as follows: first, we begin with a review of the literature on circular business models, before\\nnarrowing down to the circular plastic economy and the relevance of digital technologies. This is followed by an outline of the\\nmethodological approach, and the presentation of findings from a recent qualitative study of circular plastic innovators across the\\nAfrican continent. The results are then discussed in the light of their impact on retailing and distribution systems. The paper concludes\\nwith critical reflections, implications for policy and practice, and recommendations for future research agenda.\\n2. Literature review\\n2.1. Circular business models\\nIn recent times, scholars have acknowledged the necessity for significant shifts in conventional business strategies, value chain\\noperations, and ultimately, business models toward advancing global circular economy ambitions (Rosa, Sassanelli and Terzi, 2019;\\nFerasso et al., 2020; Toth-Peter et al., 2023). According to Bican and Brem, (2020), the business model concept is understood as a firm’s\\nfundamental logic and preferred strategic approach for generating and capturing value across its business operations. Similarly,\\nFerasso et al., (2020) surmise that the business model approach facilitates the holistic examination of an organisation’s value creation\\nprocess by outlining certain complementary activities, decisions, functions, and systemic elements that are all interconnected. Early\\ndefinitions of the concept highlight three main value areas including: value proposition (Berman, 2012; Baden-Fuller and Haefliger,\\n2013), value creation (Beattie and Smith, 2013; Bocken et al., 2014), and value capture (Teece, 2010; Zott and Amit, 2001). The\\nbusiness model paradigm evolved simultaneously with an increasing requirement for faster and more efficient strategies for sys-\\ntematically analysing, organising and disseminating complex business ideas tailored towards a boost in organisational performance\\nand increased competitive advantage (Lopes de Sousa Jabbour et al., 2019). In addition, businesses are currently under rising pressure\\nto evolve beyond the current firm-centric mode of operation to systemic/network-centric methods involving engagement with diverse\\nactors, society, and the environment. Such transformation requires innovative re-evaluation and redesign of existing business models,\\nmaking business model innovation an essential competency for business firms and organisations (Pieroni, McAloone and Pigosso,\\n2019; Moktadir et al., 2020). The business model innovation concept suggests substantial purposive transformation to the structure\\nand fundamental components of business models (Bican and Brem, 2020). Business model innovation entails the development of new', metadata={'source': '/Users/admin/Documents/pdf_file_blobs/-files-94614918-Ajala2024VoR.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/admin/Documents/pdf_file_blobs/-files-94614918-Ajala2024VoR.pdf', 'page': 3, 'total_pages': 17, 'Author': 'Kolade et al', 'CreationDate': \"D:20240529140251+01'00'\", 'Creator': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro DC (64-bit) 21.1.20135', 'ModDate': \"D:20240529140401+01'00'\", 'Producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro DC (64-bit) 21.1.20135', 'Title': 'Digitally enabled business models for a circular plastic economy in Africa'}), Document(page_content='and fundamental components of business models (Bican and Brem, 2020). Business model innovation entails the development of new\\nbusiness models, diversifying into distinct types of business models, the procurement of new business models or the conversion from\\none business model to another Geissdoerfer et al., (2018). It also incorporates social and environment objectives alongside economic\\noutcomes in what has been described as. triple-layered model of economic, social and environmental value creation (Kolade et al.,\\n2021).\\nFogarassy and Finger (2020) highlight ’linear risks’ in business-as-usual procedures that contribute to adverse trends. These include\\nthe scarcity of primary resources, price instability, reduced efficiency in supply chains, lower renewable energy costs, and restrictions\\non waste trading. Scholars have also argued that the economic benefits of linear industrial systems have become threats to modern\\nbusinesses (Salvador et al., 2020; Andersen and Wicken, 2021). This necessitates the adoption of proactive measures to promote\\nsustainable resource utilisation by virtue of more sustainable business models.\\nThe incorporation of circular economy principles in business models offers an opportunity to achieve enhanced resource efficiency,\\ndynamic competitive advantage and value chain productivity (Bocken and Geradts, 2020). It proposes a new model of resource flow i.\\ne., ‘extract-use-waste-renew’ distinct from the conventional linear pattern of resource flow i.e., extract-use-waste. This is achieved\\nthrough a disruption from existing linear resource cycles towards closed-loop resource flows, such that the utility and environmental\\nvalue of resources is sustained whilst economic value is concurrently extended (Urbinati, Chiaroni and Chiesa, 2017; Rehman Khan\\net al., 2022). Research in the field of manufacturing suggests that the principles of the circular economy are ideally suited to business\\nmodel innovation strategies. The incorporation of these principles into well-known business models defines what is known as the\\ncircular business model paradigm (Pieroni et al., 2019).\\nCircular business models are business models that help to minimise resource consumption, waste and emissions from an organ-\\nisational unit through the processes of cycling (recycling measures), extending (prolonged usage), intensifying (more intense use and\\nvalue maximisation) and dematerialisation (replacement of physical commodities and service with software-based solutions) of energy\\nand material cycles (Geissdoerfer et al., (2020). However, in the domain of business models and industrial operations, experts have\\ngrappled with the impracticality of a completely “circular” system, devoid of any material or energy loss/leakages (Centobelli et al.,\\n2020; Geissdoerfer et al., 2020; Salvador et al., 2020). Accordingly, circular business model innovation describes the design and\\nimplementation of new or diversified business models in alignment with circular economy principles and practices. This may\\nsignificantly impact the entire value chain, the business model and its components or the relationships between its elements (Geiss-\\ndoerfer et al., 2020; Guldmann and Huulgaard, 2020). It targets a disruption in the way economic value and product development are\\n3', metadata={'source': '/Users/admin/Documents/pdf_file_blobs/-files-94614918-Ajala2024VoR.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/admin/Documents/pdf_file_blobs/-files-94614918-Ajala2024VoR.pdf', 'page': 3, 'total_pages': 17, 'Author': 'Kolade et al', 'CreationDate': \"D:20240529140251+01'00'\", 'Creator': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro DC (64-bit) 21.1.20135', 'ModDate': \"D:20240529140401+01'00'\", 'Producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro DC (64-bit) 21.1.20135', 'Title': 'Digitally enabled business models for a circular plastic economy in Africa'}), Document(page_content='O.

Firstly, the\\nupstream circular process which entails introducing adjustments to the value proposition and value creation aspects of business models.\\nThese include circular product and process design i.e., design for X(DfX) and development to enable reverse logistics (redistribution\\nand reuse, remanufacturing, and recycling) subject to the influence of various stakeholders, including investors, manufacturers,\\nproducers, and suppliers. Secondly, the downstream circular processes which encompasses value capture and delivery through the\\nimplementation of novel revenue schemes and innovative customer engagement strategies, such as product dematerialisation and\\nservitisation (pay-per-use models), involving the activities of retailers, customers, and end users. And lastly, the fully circular which\\nintegrates both upstream and downstream circular economy processes and business stakeholders, with the ultimate objective of\\nachieving a balance in benefits accrued for the environment and the economy (Urbinati et al., 2017; Centobelli et al., 2020;\\nUrbinatiet al., 2021).\\nEffective management for reverse logistics requires greater expertise and resources, compared to forward logistics, thus novel\\ntechnologies, infrastructure and platforms must be in place to facilitate the exchange of relevant information between internal and\\nexternal associates as well as the overall system efficiency (Moktadir et al., 2020; Rasool et al., 2023). For example, plastic retailers, as\\nmajor stakeholders in the downstream value chain occupy a strategic position in the drive towards the circular economy because they\\nare the link between producers/wholesalers and consumers (Butt et al., 2023). They can be critical conduits of awareness campaigns\\nand public education in a committed drive to shape public opinion and re-orientate consumers towards the adoption of circular habits\\nof consumption (Vadakkepatt et al., 2021). In addition, sustainable retailing is increasingly seen as a competitive imperative, as plastic\\ncompanies seek to differentiate themselves from others, and thereby attract new and loyal customers, by emphasising their sustain-\\nability values (Alzoubi et al., 2020).\\n2.2. The business case for circular plastics\\nIn contrast with traditional linear business models, circular business models aim to extract greater value from every unit of resource\\n(Maio and Rem, 2015). They can be rightly seen as an industrial model that facilitates the decoupling of economic growth from\\nmaterial input. Extant scholarship has recognised the vital role that circular business model can play within the plastic industry. For\\nexample, the application of the circular business model can contribute to slowing and closing the plastic material loop (Whalen, 2019)\\nThe escalating demand for plastic has increasingly highlighted the critical issues associated with excessive use and reliance on plastic\\nmaterials in developing African countries (Klemeˇs et al., 2020).\\nAfrican countries are progressively exploring and adopting circular plastic business models as they navigate the complexities of\\nsustainable materials management. There is therefore an auspicious opportunity to shape the future of the market for circular plastic\\nproducts. Circular plastic business model are promising business strategy that can promote economic benefits while also promoting\\nenvironmental conservation, economic opportunities and ensuring sustainable impact (Khan et al., 2021) circularity activities such as\\nrecycling, reuse, repurposing, retailing and remanufacturing, redistribution of plastic materials can have directly or indirectly social', metadata={'source': '/Users/admin/Documents/pdf_file_blobs/-files-94614918-Ajala2024VoR.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/admin/Documents/pdf_file_blobs/-files-94614918-Ajala2024VoR.pdf', 'page': 4, 'total_pages': 17, 'Author': 'Kolade et al', 'CreationDate': \"D:20240529140251+01'00'\", 'Creator': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro DC (64-bit) 21.1.20135', 'ModDate': \"D:20240529140401+01'00'\", 'Producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro DC (64-bit) 21.1.20135', 'Title': 'Digitally enabled business models for a circular plastic economy in Africa'}), Document(page_content='recycling, reuse, repurposing, retailing and remanufacturing, redistribution of plastic materials can have directly or indirectly social\\nimpact when it comes to managing plastic waste challenges (Maione et al., 2022; Oyinlola et al., 2022). For example, Nielsen et al.,\\n(2019) concluded that plastic bags have become an indispensable companion to many consumers, and this is despite intensified\\nconversations around single-use plastics awareness (Evode et al., 2021). This makes an important case for the adoption of a more\\nsustainable supply chain through circular plastic business models as a substitute for the current methods of managing plastic waste\\n(Geissdoerfer et al., 2020).\\nThe push for long-term sustainability plans must operate alongside detailed policies to guide supply chain optimization; consumer\\neducation to promote engagement and innovation to ensure collaboration for a successful circular plastic system to drive economic\\ngrowth in Africa (Maione et al., 2022). In addition, the business model simply ensures full maximisation of the plastic material and\\nproduct (Khan et al., 2021). The plastic industry supply chain can benefit from polices such as the Extended Producer Responsibility\\n(EPR). The introduction of the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) principle in most developed countries has also emerged as a\\nvital tool promoting the actualisation of a circular economy for plastic products. Similarly, Schro¨der and Oyinlola (2023) suggested\\nthat the introduction of plastic policies on a national level is a critical component that has the potential to shape the circular plastic\\neconomy, especially in Africa. For example, the EPR policy has encouraged recycling and upcycling start-ups businesses in Nigeria to\\nvalorise post-consumer plastics which has become a massive business opportunity, advancing the concept of circularity to create and\\ncapture value across the plastic value chain (Dijkstra et al., 2020). Furthermore, it is characterised by an economic instrument that\\noffers product manufacturers financial rewards to enact the EPR policy through a variety of means. These include advance disposal fees\\n(ADF), which are charges levied on specific items at the point of sale according to the estimated costs of waste collection and treatment\\nwith the intention for use in meeting the financial demands of EoL management of the purchased product (Pouikli, 2020). However,\\nthe full potential is yet to be attained as a strict enforcement of this policy is lacking (Oyinlola et al., 2022). Nonetheless, there are\\npromising opportunities for these policies to ensure businesses that operate within the plastic sector rethink its mode of operation and\\ncontribute to optimising inventory, forecasting, logistic scheduling, thereby improving the efficiency and effectiveness of retailing and\\ndistribution system within the plastic industry (Sylvester and Ikudayisi, 2021)\\nConsumer education plays a vital role in driving the circular plastic economy. Raising the awareness of circular plastic business\\nmodel and its potential environmental and social benefits can promote consumer engagement and rapid adoption. For example, the\\nlaunching a recycling awareness program can incentives consumers will increase recycling rate and promote behavioural change and\\nminimize plastic pollution (Soares et al., 2021).\\n4', metadata={'source': '/Users/admin/Documents/pdf_file_blobs/-files-94614918-Ajala2024VoR.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/admin/Documents/pdf_file_blobs/-files-94614918-Ajala2024VoR.pdf', 'page': 4, 'total_pages': 17, 'Author': 'Kolade et al', 'CreationDate': \"D:20240529140251+01'00'\", 'Creator': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro DC (64-bit) 21.1.20135', 'ModDate': \"D:20240529140401+01'00'\", 'Producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro DC (64-bit) 21.1.20135', 'Title': 'Digitally enabled business models for a circular plastic economy in Africa'}), Document(page_content='O.

A close collaborative system can\\ncontribute to scaling up the operations within circular business model (De Angelis et al., 2018). For example, initiatives such as Africa\\nCircular Economy Network facilitate partnerships between various stakeholders to foster mutually beneficial relationships for material\\nredistribution that will enhance supply chain operations (Desmond and Asamba, 2019). The success of a circular business model\\nrequires the coming together of many companies and stakeholders within the eco-system to close the loop within the plastic industry\\n(Antikainen et al., 2018).\\nAccording to (Dijkstra et al., 2020), digital innovations are also essential for the effective implementation of the circular business\\nmodel. The objective of the circular business model is to maintain the value of plastics in the economy and keep them in circulation\\n(Getor et al., 2020). In addition, it also offers a chance to guarantee a seamless supply chain management, provide consumers with\\nreal-time information, and co-create by facilitating collaboration among stakeholders.\\n2.3. Digital innovations for circular plastic business models\\nDigital Innovations are at the heart of business model innovations in the 21st century where the ubiquity of the internet and the\\nrapid pace of digital transformation offer new vistas of opportunities for businesses to create, deliver and capture value. This is\\narguably more important for the circular economy, where the opportunities for creative destruction and disruption of the linear\\neconomy lend themselves to the innovative deployment of digital technologies. The application of digital technologies in the circular\\nplastic economy is highlighted by the development of mobile apps to mobilise and connect a wide range of stakeholders, the\\ndeployment of digital finance to incentivise plastic waste collection, the application of blockchain solutions for traceability and\\ntransparency of circular plastic supply chains, and the application of 3D printing to create new products, thereby delivering value for\\nconsumers, and elongating plastic lifecycle.\\nFirstly, the development of mobile apps has played a key role in the implementation of innovative business models in the circular\\nplastic retail markets. Mobile apps can help facilitate a more efficient collection of plastic waste, thereby mitigating resource con-\\nstraints for upcyclers (Shan et al., 2021). They can also serve as effective platforms for the open exchange of upcycling know-how.\\nFurthermore, the deployment of mobile payment technologies has enhanced the value of mobile phones, transforming them into\\nfinancial platforms (Kurniawan et al., 2022). This potentially brings millions of consumers and regular households into the circular\\nplastic market, enabling them to undertake online transactions of recycled products. In this respect, mobile apps can be integrated with\\nblockchain solutions via blockchain tokens that can be used to mobilise and incentivise households, especially in low-income com-\\nmunities to be actively involved in plastic waste collection and sorting (Verma et al., 2022). These integrated mobile apps have also\\nbeen used to organise deposit refund systems (Reloop Platform, 2022).\\nIn addition to their integration into payment technologies and applications in digital tokens, blockchain technology can enable the\\nFig. 1.

It\\nharnesses the three key principles of trust, traceability and transparency to integrate three supply chain reverse processes- recycle,\\nredistribute and remanufacture (Centobelli et al., 2022). This enables recyclers and other stakeholders to easily access and monitor key\\nproduct information such as quality, quantity, location and ownership (Huang et al., 2022). In addition to these information trans-\\nparency features, blockchains also offer new pathways for value creation and value capture by facilitating open innovation and\\nknowledge exchange about novel, sustainable plastic production processes using, for example, cloud-based knowledge sharing systems\\n(Li et al., 2018). Furthermore, blockchains can drive process optimisation in the logistics of plastic manufacturing process, including\\noptimisation of transportation route maps and schedules, and the use of smart contracts to manage the interaction between traders,\\nthereby avoiding cheating that is often associated with manual systems (Xu and He, 2022).\\nFor remanufacturing, 3D printing offers highly promising potential as an enabler of innovative circular economy business models\\n(Chaudhuri et al., 2022). By favouring the economy of one in place of the economy of scale that underpins traditional, subtractive\\nmanufacturing, 3D printing upends the structural and resource advantage of big manufacturers, bringing SMEs and local micro-\\nenterprises into play (Kolade et al., 2022). It also removes the need for centralised high-volume production and large inventory\\nstocking. These characteristics are well suited to a circular plastic economy, as local SMEs can use plastic wastes to make filaments for\\n3D printing of new products (Oyinlola et al., 2023). Partly as a result of the economy of one and the unique opportunities for cus-\\ntomised products, 3D printed products from plastic wastes have been shown to be cost-effective, in one reported example costing 10%\\nless than traditionally manufactured products (Heikkinen et al., 2018).\\nBringing the above discussions together, we introduce a conceptual framework to highlight the key mechanisms through digital\\ninnovations can drive value creation and value capture across the three key supply chain reverse processes: recycle, redistribution and\\nremanufacture (Fig. 1).\\n3. Methodology\\n3.1. Focus group discussions and semi-structured interviews\\nTo gather in-depth qualitative data on the circular plastic economy and the use of digital innovations for managing plastic waste in\\nAfrica, a series of focus group discussions was conducted.

This diverse mix ensured a comprehensive view from all sectors involved in plastic waste management and\\nyielded a total of 16 focus group sessions. The selection of these locations was strategic, aimed at capturing a wide array of insights\\nrepresentative of the entire African continent. By incorporating opinions from these varied regions, the research aimed to reflect the\\ncontinent’s diverse challenges and innovations in plastic waste management.\\nComplementing these discussions, a tailored semi-structured questionnaire was sent electronically to 39 organisations identified\\nthrough literature reviews and databases as key players deploying digital innovation in waste management practices on the continent.\\nOf these, 17 organisations completed the semi-structured questionnaire, providing additional nuanced data. The instruments for both\\nthe focus groups and the questionnaire were meticulously crafted to align with established concepts and principles from existing\\nliterature, ensuring that the data collection process was both rigorous and relevant to the study’s overarching goals. Full profiles of the\\norganisations were described in (Oyinlola et al., 2022).\\n3.2. Thematic analysis\\nThe transcripts of the focus group discussions and electronic semi-structured interviews were cleaned and then fed into NVivo 12\\nfor processing and thematic analysis. In line with the six-step procedure recommended by Braun and Clarke, (2006), we first read and\\nre-read the transcripts, noting down initial ideas captured in a series of vignettes. These vignettes were mapped, in the third step,\\nagainst first order themes. In the fourth step, the first order themes were reviewed to generate a thematic map of the analysis. In the\\nfifth step, the themes were refined and defined against aggregate dimensions, as outlined in Fig. 2. In the final step, compelling extract\\nexamples were selected from the themes to explicate the key ideas in relation to the extant literature.\\nThe Tables 1 and 2 below provide an overview of focus group participants and a profile of 17 organisations engaged in circular\\nplastic innovations across African countries.

Results\\nThree higher order themes were identified from the transcribed data: challenges and opportunities for circular business models;\\ndigital innovations and value capture in CPE; and the ecosystem effects.\\n4.1. Circular business models: challenges and opportunities\\nThe focus group participants highlighted a number of issues relating to the viability of circular business models and the struggle\\nenterprises have faced with investment opportunities and market traction.

OK, what is the cost of us selling it to the recycler because your business model is not refined (Speaker 4, Zambian Start-ups\\nFocus Group, Lusaka, October 2020).\\nIn order to address this identified flaws and gaps in business models, university researchers are stepping into the space to offer\\nconsultancy services for businesses and public sector organisations. In Namibia, researchers are working with local councils and other\\nstakeholders to help undertake evaluations and refine the business case for circular plastic, as the following focus group participant\\nsurmised:\\nSo, we worked with the Oshakati Town Council. And we talked about that, and we started different research. So, we quantified the\\nwaste in Oshakati, then we sort of did the business case, what is the economic potential of recycling and how much. What’s this volume\\nof business that can be generated? Then we’ve done a study on various models, cooperative models, or should we go with big factories\\nand things like that? We’ve done that. (Speaker 4, Namibia Academia Focus Group, Windhoek, August, 2020)\\nOther stakeholders and smaller enterprises are tackling the challenge of market traction by actively seeking partnership with larger\\ncorporations with environmental values. These include partnership with companies who have a strong commitment to designing\\nproducts for easier disassembly and recycling, and those who use recycled material in their production activities. In Nigeria, an\\numbrella organisation of circular enterprise owners formed a partnership with a cement company:\\nOne of the major things we have also done is we’ve had a partnership with Lafarge. Lafarge is a cement company that uses\\nalternative forms of fuel to for their cement processing. So, there is a process that they’ve just initiated which is called coprocessing.\\nThey use alternate fuel derived from another source of fuel that may not be coal or fossil fuels (Speaker 3, Nigeria Start-ups, Lagos,\\nOctober 2020).\\n4.2. Digital innovations for value creation in CPE\\nPartly in response to the challenges of viability and scalability associated with circular business models, focus group and interview\\nrespondents have identified the critical importance of digital innovations as key drivers of value creation and value capture in the\\ncircular plastic economy. One of the key impacts for circular enterprises is the deployment of digital innovations to lower costs through\\noptimisation of resources, processes and logistics. Through digital platforms, innovators are able to bring together key stakeholders\\nsuch as waste pickers, transporters and recyclers in a more efficient collaborative synergy, as these focus group participants highlight:\\nOur primary focus is on optimising Uh, processes and workflows for organizations and in the waste management sector. We\\nbasically help companies that are engaged in recycling and disposal optimize their logistics and recovery of materials from source to\\nfinal disposal (Speaker 8, Zambian Start-ups Focus Group, Lusaka, October 2020).\\n“…they can also engage with consumers and say, informal waste pickers out there on a digital platform.

They can then have much\\nmore better-informed insights into their operation as a whole, and we feel that if such companies become profitable. It essentially\\nmeans that the waste pickers can then supply more waste. If the transporters are more efficient, more waste can be recovered, and so\\nmore waste can be sold to processors and so more revenue can be generated in the market and so we see the application of digital\\ntechnology and the transportation of Waste materials weather for the driver to scale in the sector” (Speaker 8, Zambian Start-ups Focus\\nGroup, Lusaka, October 2020).\\nOne example of these digital platform applications was set up by Yo Waste, a Ugandan circular Start-up. It has gone on to achieve\\nconsiderable success through its deployment of various features including route optimisation and collector-recycler matching features.\\nAltogether these enhance the efficiency of the waste collection and recycling processes, as this FG participant describes:\\nWe have an application for customers whereby. This application gets the exact location of a customer and helps connect them to a\\nreliable, affordable waste collector in the area, right? So, these people don’t really have to rely on that front collector was to check out\\nthe problem of inefficiency. What we do is that this person signs up with Yo Waste and they say I want a collection (Speaker 3, East\\nAfrican Start-ups and Innovators, Virtual Interview, August 2020)\\nImagine a system whereby a person, uh, that has a smart form right, can download an application. Application can be able to pick\\ntheir, uh, their geo location, let it be their home or their office, and …this person can be able to search for a collector in their vicinity\\nand when they find this collector, this collector will be able to come and collect at no extra cost…So imagine something like that and\\nthen go ahead and add in something like this waste collector is also given a mobile application that allows him to manage jobs from\\nother clients. Because we didn’t only talk to customers, but we also went ahead to talk to these west collectors’ haulers because\\ncustomers had problems like inefficiency (Speaker 3, Rwandan Start-ups and Innovators, Kigali, August 2020)\\nOthers highlighted the potentials for job creation by deploying digital technologies to mobilise and sort abundantly available\\ndisused resources for value creation and value capture, though, for example, the re-use of plastic wastes in additive manufacturing.\\n9', metadata={'source': '/Users/admin/Documents/pdf_file_blobs/-files-94614918-Ajala2024VoR.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/admin/Documents/pdf_file_blobs/-files-94614918-Ajala2024VoR.pdf', 'page': 9, 'total_pages': 17, 'Author': 'Kolade et al', 'CreationDate': \"D:20240529140251+01'00'\", 'Creator': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro DC (64-bit) 21.1.20135', 'ModDate': \"D:20240529140401+01'00'\", 'Producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro DC (64-bit) 21.1.20135', 'Title': 'Digitally enabled business models for a circular plastic economy in Africa'}), Document(page_content='O.

And among the youth, there’s\\na 16% unemployment rate. So now you wonder to say look, there’s an industry here in which resources are largely available. And then\\nyou, you wonder to say OK, why isn’t there public and private sector engagement? Because this is actually an industry…if I can put it to\\nyou honestly, that if we were to mobilize ourselves as a sector and the players in charge, we could reduce unemployment rate\\nsignificantly (Speaker 6, Zambian Start-ups Focus Group, Lusaka, October 2020).\\nfrom a technical perspective, when we look at the collection of waste materials, whether for disposal or reuse, or perhaps recycling.\\nOne of the challenges we’re experiencing almost on a daily basis and where we see digital technology helping to a great extent is in the\\ndiscovery of materials. First that is: how can you as a Waste collector who is involved in recycling find materials within your com-\\nmunity that are ready for pickup, for example, or that have been separated and properly classified? So, discovery is a huge challenge,\\nnot only for us as a platform provider but also for the players, the aggregators, the buyers and also the waste collectors. (Speaker 8,\\nZambian Start-ups Focus Group, Lusaka, October 2020).\\nWhen it comes to plastic in particular, we see digital technology and particularly additive manufacturing or commonly known as 3D\\nprinting Being one of those. Technologies that could emerge from the use of digital technology to actually help reduce and hopefully\\neliminate plastic. The beauty with 3D printing is that you can actually add 100 * 1000 times value to plastic, so we see that as a huge\\nopportunity for all the players in the value chain (Speaker 8, Zambian Start-ups Focus Group, Lusaka, October 2020).\\n4.3. Digitally enabled ecosystem effects for CPE\\nGiven the fact that the circular plastic economy is a new paradigm that aims to upend the established linear paradigm of production\\nand consumption, the network effects of digital innovations is especially important for successful transition. Interviewees and focus\\ngroup participants highlighted the different ways digital innovations has enabled greater value creation and value capture by bringing\\nmany stakeholders together and thereby grown the market for circular plastic products. Here again, Yo Waste offers a prime example of\\nthe network impacts of digital innovation for CPE in Africa:\\nYo-Waste is a technology-based start-up in Kampala, Uganda that helps communities and businesses manage their waste by\\nconnecting them to different waste management players. It started in 2017 as a class project but became fully registered as a company\\nin 2019. The company currently has 7 employees (including the 5 cofounders) who handle software development, communications etc.\\nThere are about 50 registered clients and 200 one-off subscribers who use their services every month (Yo waste Co-founder, In-depth\\nInterview, Kigali, November 2020)\\nIn other words, the more clients, subscribers and stakeholders are connected to the network, the better and greater the value\\ncreated and captured by individual actors. The informal sector, including waste pickers, constitute a critical building block of the CPE\\necosystem. Unsurprisingly, investors are focusing increasing attention to organise the informal sector:\\nA lack of investable private projects, and sometimes this is complicated, complicated by the involvement of the informal sector\\nbeing so important. So, organizing that informal sector seemed like a challenge that the investors were interested in.\\nAnd maybe then you also encourage the informal sector to collect more waste, and also it’s a very important fact to understand that', metadata={'source': '/Users/admin/Documents/pdf_file_blobs/-files-94614918-Ajala2024VoR.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/admin/Documents/pdf_file_blobs/-files-94614918-Ajala2024VoR.pdf', 'page': 10, 'total_pages': 17, 'Author': 'Kolade et al', 'CreationDate': \"D:20240529140251+01'00'\", 'Creator': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro DC (64-bit) 21.1.20135', 'ModDate': \"D:20240529140401+01'00'\", 'Producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro DC (64-bit) 21.1.20135', 'Title': 'Digitally enabled business models for a circular plastic economy in Africa'}), Document(page_content='And maybe then you also encourage the informal sector to collect more waste, and also it’s a very important fact to understand that\\nmost of the people that are in the informal sector are just unemployed people and also very poor usually …I think maybe if you do it in\\nthis way that you also have maybe a return back scheme for maybe the bigger plastics, maybe that could also benefit these informal\\nsectors somehow\\nAside from informal sector workers, innovators and start-ups are also able to reap greater benefits by coming together and\\norganising themselves into groups. This includes the increased ability of the collective to overcome traditional barriers and constraints\\nto funding- such as deposits and collateral requirements- faced by individual start-ups and enterprises:\\nSo, from a bank perspective, I can clearly see that the network can maybe assist by engaging like the Green Climate Fund and see\\nhow we can, you know, establish a type of funding fund that specifically focuses on this sector. That can assist any project that is\\nactually not bankable due to a limited deposit or collateral requirements as a bank or any financial institution we’re providing loans\\nwill require. So, I think if we can maybe try to schedule or, you know, established a small partnership with these federal funding\\nfacilities that can provide a type of ground facility to kickstart some of these Start-up companies and also take it to a bankable level\\n(Speaker 6, Namibia Investors Focus Group, Windhoek, October 2020).\\nComing together in a network also enable actors to share best practices, and support and scale complementary activities for the\\nbenefit not only of individual network members but the network as a collective:\\nOK, if you want to change behaviours and you want to get innovation into certain places that’s funded. If you want to have pol-\\nicies…especially in Africa, you need a kind of system to hold all that together, and so it’s a multi sectoral interdisciplinary network…\\nWe have members from Southern Africa, East Africa, West Africa and we’re trying to collaborate and share knowledge across that\\nplatform so it could be anyone who’s trying to solve this issue who’s trying to drive the transition so it could be a Start-up or even a\\nprivate person or a government agency… How are we serving the different Members of this network? Ultimately, we can apply for\\nsome follow-on funding to scale this whole thing up and the people that are part of the network are going to be part of us creating this\\npitch to get the follow-on funding and we hope that people will get leverage of the network (Speaker 1, Rwandan Investors Focus\\nGroup, Kigali, August 2020)\\n10', metadata={'source': '/Users/admin/Documents/pdf_file_blobs/-files-94614918-Ajala2024VoR.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/admin/Documents/pdf_file_blobs/-files-94614918-Ajala2024VoR.pdf', 'page': 10, 'total_pages': 17, 'Author': 'Kolade et al', 'CreationDate': \"D:20240529140251+01'00'\", 'Creator': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro DC (64-bit) 21.1.20135', 'ModDate': \"D:20240529140401+01'00'\", 'Producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro DC (64-bit) 21.1.20135', 'Title': 'Digitally enabled business models for a circular plastic economy in Africa'}), Document(page_content='O.

Digital innovations and network effects for circular transition\\nAs noted in the introduction, arguably the biggest barrier to the circular economy, is the lock-in to the linear paradigm of pro-\\nduction and consumption. In order to upend this trajectory, circular products and practices need to break the linear lock-in mecha-\\nnisms by, among other things, creating new network externalities. This is where innovative circular business models, enabled by digital\\ntechnologies, are of critical importance. The findings from this study indicate that start-ups and innovators across Africa have iden-\\ntified the digitalisation gap and are deploying digital technologies to drive the transition towards a circular plastic economy on the\\ncontinent.\\nFirst, there is evidence of multi-channel and omni-channel practices by innovators and start-ups. These are critical to value creation\\nand value capture in the circular plastic economy. Omni-channels offer the customer the opportunity to interact with several channels\\noffered by a provider in a seamless experience that optimises logistics and minimises costs (Costa Climent et al., 2022; Salvietti et al.,\\n2022). For example, the Ugandan Startup, Yo Waste provides channels for haulers, recyclers, municipalities, and households. It also\\noffers services across multiple industries, including hotels and hospitality, restaurants and food services, grocery stores, and medical\\nfacilities. This not only optimises experiences for users but also provides an auspicious opportunity for providers to aggregate customer\\ndata insights to create better value and improve user experience.\\nThe provision of multi-channel and omni-channel services by African digital innovators has also, crucially, enabled the creation of\\nnew network externalities necessary to break the lock-in to the linear economy. As the result shows, mobile apps are being used to\\nmobilise tens of thousands of households and thousands of informal waste pickers into the circular economy ecosystem, where re-\\ncyclers and other circular plastic enterprises can connect with them, and big corporations can also engage in more meaningful and\\nimpactful ways. As more and more actors connect within and across national boundaries, circular plastic enterprises are better able to\\ncreate and capture value (Kolade et al., 2022). Furthermore, as other studies have reported, network effects can help lower the cost of\\nswitching from linear to circular plastic products; raise demand for, and value of, circular plastic products, and support stakeholder\\npressures for enabling policies and institutional innovations for a circular plastic economy (Czajkowski and Sobolewski, 2016;\\nWeiergraeber, 2022).\\nThese network effects can have a pathbreaking impact on the circular plastic economy in Africa, driving market growth, job\\ncreation, and economic empowerment, particularly within the informal sector. As more entities join the circular plastic initiative, the\\nvalue of the network increases, attracting additional stakeholders and resources, thus accelerating market expansion. This is line with\\nthe findings of other scholars who highlighted the importance of network externalities on market growth for green products (Liu, 2024;\\nMuzamwese et al., 2024). This growth catalyses the creation of new jobs, ranging from collection to processing and remanufacturing of\\nplastic waste, which can absorb a considerable portion of the unemployed and underemployed population.\\nIn particular, the informal sector, which is often the backbone of waste management in many African countries, can see a transition\\nfrom marginalisation to economic empowerment. As the network expands, informal workers gain access to more robust systems,\\ntraining, and financial incentives, aligning with formal economic activities and contributing significantly to the industry’s\\nproductivity.', metadata={'source': '/Users/admin/Documents/pdf_file_blobs/-files-94614918-Ajala2024VoR.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/admin/Documents/pdf_file_blobs/-files-94614918-Ajala2024VoR.pdf', 'page': 11, 'total_pages': 17, 'Author': 'Kolade et al', 'CreationDate': \"D:20240529140251+01'00'\", 'Creator': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro DC (64-bit) 21.1.20135', 'ModDate': \"D:20240529140401+01'00'\", 'Producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro DC (64-bit) 21.1.20135', 'Title': 'Digitally enabled business models for a circular plastic economy in Africa'}), Document(page_content='training, and financial incentives, aligning with formal economic activities and contributing significantly to the industry’s\\nproductivity.\\nThis scenario presents a dual opportunity: it harnesses the untapped potential of the unemployed and underemployed population,\\neffectively turning labour waste to productive economic purposes. In the same breadth, it simultaneously transforms the abundance of\\nplastic waste into valuable products. Thus, by creating a structured and inclusive recycling ecosystem, network effects foster a self-\\nreinforcing cycle where plastic waste becomes a resource, jobs are created, and communities thrive, leading to a sustainable and\\nprosperous economy.\\n5.2. Digital transformation of retailing and distribution logistics for CPE\\nFinally, digital innovations play key roles in strengthening and simplifying the logistics of retailing and distribution systems for a\\ncircular plastic economy. Logistics infrastructure is the missing link and has been identified by industry stakeholders as one of the\\nmajor factors affecting the transboundary movement of plastic waste within the circular plastic economy industry. Digitally enabled\\nreverse logistics is being effectively deployed to close the loop for more efficient collection. These include the adoption of AI-based\\nreverse logistics by small and medium scale enterprises to monitor products as they move through the supply chain (Mukherjee\\net al., 2024). Yet, scaling of these innovations remain a challenge on the African continent. These technologies are critical success\\nfactors for the circular plastic economyand plastic enabling actors to optimise value creation and value capture (Julianelli et al., 2020).\\nTherefore, to achieve an effective logistics network, digital innovations supporting communication, knowledge and data sharing\\nshould be introduced to the existing reverse logistics system. This will ensure a more effective and efficient infrastructure network for\\nvalue creation, delivery and capture. The value will include but not be limited to the timely collection of scheduled plastic waste, route\\nmapping and logistics resource maximisation.\\n5.3. Theoretical contributions and practical implications\\nGiven the foregoing, this paper makes two important contributions. Firstly, it proposes a new conceptual framework that explicates\\nthe mediating roles of digital innovations in the processes of value creation and value capture across a whole spectrum of circular\\neconomy reverse logistics activities: recycling, redistribution and remanufacture. Secondly, the paper highlights the double-sided\\n11', metadata={'source': '/Users/admin/Documents/pdf_file_blobs/-files-94614918-Ajala2024VoR.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/admin/Documents/pdf_file_blobs/-files-94614918-Ajala2024VoR.pdf', 'page': 11, 'total_pages': 17, 'Author': 'Kolade et al', 'CreationDate': \"D:20240529140251+01'00'\", 'Creator': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro DC (64-bit) 21.1.20135', 'ModDate': \"D:20240529140401+01'00'\", 'Producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro DC (64-bit) 21.1.20135', 'Title': 'Digitally enabled business models for a circular plastic economy in Africa'}), Document(page_content='O.

The limited industrial development of the African\\ncontinent, and the associated limited sunk investment in old technologies, is a blessing in disguise with regards to new opportunities to\\nleapfrog developed countries in innovative green technologies and achieve market leadership in the circular economy. Similarly, the\\nproblem of unemployment and underemployment, especially in the informal economy, is also an opportunity to empower a ready and\\notherwise under-used labour force for the circular economy. Furthermore, the resource constraints in African economies, in terms of\\nfinished products, is an opportunity to enact an innovative sharing economy in which otherwise idle products and resources are more\\nefficiently used in a process of collaborative consumption.\\nAfrica’s relatively untapped industrial progress presents a unique opportunity for policymakers to drive green growth by leap-\\nfrogging to advanced green technologies. This approach can position the continent as a front-runner in the circular economy. The\\nprevalent unemployment and underemployment, especially within the informal sector, offers a potential workforce ready to be\\nengaged in this sustainable economic model. Policymakers can further utilise the continent’s resource scarcity by promoting a sharing\\neconomy, ensuring efficient use of available products and resources through community-led initiatives. Together, these steps can\\ncreate an economy that not only conserves resources but also fosters equitable wealth distribution and inclusive growth.\\n5.4. Limitations and future research agenda\\nWe highlight two limitations of the present study. Contextually, while a cross-country study like this provides valuable insights on\\ncommon challenges and opportunities shared across countries, it is limited in its ability to grapple with the peculiar characteristics and\\nnuances of individual countries and the specific opportunities for a circular plastic economy. While our study is broad enough in its\\nreach of Southern Africa, East Africa and West Africa sub-regions, we acknowledge that the selected countries may not be sufficiently\\nrepresentative of each sub-region, let alone the entire sub-Sahara Africa. Future studies can focus on specific country case studies.\\nSecondly, while the qualitative method is well suited for this present research design, there is a need for longitudinal studies and data\\ncollection from African countries over a sustained period of time, to offer valuable data for researchers interested in digging up\\nimportant new insights about the circular plastic economy in Africa.\\n6. Conclusion\\nThis paper focuses on the imperative of a business case for a circular plastic economy, in order to drive a successful transition from a\\nlinear to circular paradigm of production and consumption. The ecological case for a circular plastic economy has been well made over\\nthe past few decades. However, transition has been slowed by limited uptake of circular products by consumers, and an inadequate\\nsynergy among actors in the circular plastic ecosystem. In order to invigorate and accelerate transition, innovative business models are\\nrequired to expand the ecosystem and simplify the logistics of retailing and distribution systems through the deployment of appro-\\npriate digital innovations. The circular plastic economy has won hearts but now needs to win the market. The new network exter-\\nnalities created by the popularisation of circular products in the consumer market can play a key role in breaking the lock-in to\\notherwise entrenched linear habits of consumption.\\nAuthor agreement statement\\nWe the undersigned declare that this manuscript is original, has not been published before and is not currently being considered for\\npublication elsewhere.', metadata={'source': '/Users/admin/Documents/pdf_file_blobs/-files-94614918-Ajala2024VoR.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/admin/Documents/pdf_file_blobs/-files-94614918-Ajala2024VoR.pdf', 'page': 12, 'total_pages': 17, 'Author': 'Kolade et al', 'CreationDate': \"D:20240529140251+01'00'\", 'Creator': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro DC (64-bit) 21.1.20135', 'ModDate': \"D:20240529140401+01'00'\", 'Producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro DC (64-bit) 21.1.20135', 'Title': 'Digitally enabled business models for a circular plastic economy in Africa'}), Document(page_content='Author agreement statement\\nWe the undersigned declare that this manuscript is original, has not been published before and is not currently being considered for\\npublication elsewhere.\\nWe confirm that the manuscript has been read and approved by all named authors and that there are no other persons who satisfied\\nthe criteria for authorship but are not listed.
